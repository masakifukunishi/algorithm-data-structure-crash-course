# Hash Table

## What is hash?

Hash is a function that takes an input and produces a fixed-size string of characters.

### Characteristics of Hash

- Deterministic

  - Hash function always produces the same output for the same input.

- Non-Reversible

  - Hash functions are designed to be one-way functions, meaning it is impossible to get the original input from the hash output.

- Fixed Output Size

  - Hash function always produces the same size of output regardless of the input size. For example, a common hash function called SHA-256 generates a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value.

- Uniform Distribution

  - A good hash function evenly distributes hash values across its output space, reducing the likelihood of collisions.

- Avalanche Effect
  - A small change in the input should result in a significant change in the output, making it difficult to predict the original input based on the hash value alone.

## How do you make hash?

Hashes are created using algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.

SHA-256 currently has no known security issues. Since it is suitable for modern security requirements.

Here is the code to create a hash using SHA-256 in JavaScript

```js
import crypto from "crypto";

const data = "Hello!";
const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256");
hash.update(data);
// Specify a hexadecimal string
const hashedData = hash.digest("hex");

console.log(hashedData);
```

## What is Hash Table?

Hash table is a data structure that stores key value pairs.

The basic idea behind a hash table is to convert a key into a unique numerical value using hash function that represents the index in an array or a bucket[^1] where the value associated with the key will be stored.

## What do you have to care when you create the Hash Table?

- Hash Function Selection

  - Choose a suitable hash function that distributes the keys uniformly across the hash table. A good hash function minimizes collisions.

- Collision Resolution
  - Determine an appropriate strategy for handling collisions that may occur when two keys map to the same hash value. Common collision resolution techniques are separate chaining (using linked lists or other data structures to store multiple elements at the same hash index) etc.

- add(insert)
- get value by key
- find value
- remove key, value
- update value

## Exercise

### Exercise 1

Let's try to implement your own hash function. There is a good leedcode question here!

- Rules
  - **Do not ever use pre existing hash table API**
  - **If you use an array, try to fixed the size with 1000**

### Exercise 2 (Optional)

Let's try to sovle some leetcode qusiton.
These can be optimized by leveraging array and hash table data structureðŸ’ª
