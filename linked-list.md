# Linked List

## What is linked list?

Linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes[^1], where each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

## What is liked list good at?

- Sorted data

  - Linked lists can have sorted data unlike hash table, Because nodes points the next node.

- Dynamic Size

  - Linked list can dynamically grow or shrink in size during program execution. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size, linked lists can accommodate new elements or remove existing elements without requiring a reallocation of memory.

- Insertion and Deletion

  - Linked list excel at efficient insertion and deletion operations, especially at the beginning or middle of the list. Unlike arrays, which may require shifting elements to accommodate changes, linked lists only need to update a few pointers.

- Efficient Iteration

  - Singly-linked lists are efficient for forward iteration, allowing easy traversal from the beginning to the end. Doubly-linked lists can traverse in both directions, enabling forward and backward traversal.

- Merging and Splitting
  - Linked lists can be merged or split easily by manipulating the pointers.

## When is good to use liked list?

- When you need to maintain sorted data

  - If you need to maintain data in a sorted order, linked lists can be a suitable option. As the nodes in a linked list contain pointers to the next node.

- When you need dynamic size

  - If the size of your data is not known in advance or if it frequently changes, a linked list can accommodate these changes efficiently.

- When you need efficient insertion and deletion

  - If your application requires frequent insertion or deletion operations, especially at the beginning or middle of the data structure, linked lists provide efficient performance.

- When you need efficient iteration

  - If your application primarily involves sequential access to the data, linked lists provide an efficient way to iterate through the elements.

- When merging or splitting data structures
  - Linked lists a good choice when you need to combine multiple lists into one or divide a list into smaller segments.

## What is head and tail in linked list?

- Head

  - Head is the first node in the list. It is the entry point from which you can access the entire linked list structure

- Tail

  - Tail is the last node in the list. It is the node that has a reference to null or points to nothing, indicating the end of the list.

## Analysis

What is the time complexity of following operations

### access by index

- O(n)
  Accessing an element by index requires traversing the list from the head to the desired index, which takes linear time.

### insert at index

- O(n)
  Inserting an element at a specific index requires traversing the list from the head to the desired index, which takes linear time.

### delete at index

- O(n)
  Deleting an element at a specific index requires traversing the list from the head to the desired index, which takes linear time.

### joint two listed list

- O(1)
  Joining two linked lists requires updating the tail of the first list to point to the head of the second list, which takes constant time.

### add(delete) head

- O(1)
  Adding or deleting an element at the head of the linked list involves updating a few pointers, which can be done in constant time.

### add(delete) tail ---

## Exercise

### Exercise 01

Let's try to print all values in linked list.

```ts
class ListNode {
  val: number | null;
  next: ListNode | null;

  constructor(val: number | null = null, next: ListNode | null = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

const zero = new ListNode(0);
const one = new ListNode(1);
const two = new ListNode(2);
const three = new ListNode(3);
const four = new ListNode(4);
zero.next = one;
one.next = two;
two.next = three;
three.next = four;

// Write the code to iterate and print all values connected to zero
// zero is the starting point.
// Ideally, it should print like
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4

let currentNode: ListNode | null = zero;

while (currentNode !== null) {
  console.log(currentNode.val);
  currentNode = currentNode.next;
}
```

### Exercise 02

- Let's try to implement your own list
  https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/

- Hint: We can use a ListNode class used in Excersie 01
- Since 02 could be heavy task, you can try either 02 or 03

```ts

```

### Exercise 03

- Let's try to solve some leet code questions. (You dont' havet to solve all, Just one is enough for now)

- https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/
